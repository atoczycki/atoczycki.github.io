    <h2>History of Papal Conclaves</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Early Papal Elections (1st-10th Century)</dt>
        <dd>The first papal elections were not formalized. The bishop of Rome was often chosen by acclamation or a council of bishops. During the early centuries, papal succession was a blend of local traditions and imperial influence, especially under the Byzantine Empire.</dd>
    <br>
        <dt>The Medieval Period (11th-15th Century)</dt>
        <dd>In the medieval period, papal elections began to be conducted more formally. The College of Cardinals emerged as the primary body responsible for electing the pope. The papacy gained increasing political power, often influencing the selection of the pope based on temporal concerns, especially with the involvement of monarchs.</dd>
    <br>
        <dt>Renaissance and Early Modern Period (16th-18th Century)</dt>
        <dd>During the Renaissance, the College of Cardinals became the central institution for papal elections. The papal conclaves were often highly influenced by political and dynastic considerations. The election process became more organized and secretive, culminating in the conclave system that exists today.</dd>
    <br>
        <dt>Modern Period (19th Century-Present)</dt>
        <dd>The papal election process has evolved significantly, with rules established in the 19th century to ensure greater transparency and control by the College of Cardinals. The most significant change was the codification of the conclave process in 1059 under Pope Nicholas II, and later reforms by Pope Paul VI in 1975, which established the rules for electing a pope in a more formalized manner.</dd>
    <br>
        <dt>Recent Changes and the Role of the Holy Spirit</dt>
        <dd>Today, the election process remains shrouded in secrecy, and many cardinals are involved in the papal election, though the ultimate decision lies with the Holy Spirit guiding the cardinals' choice.</dd>
